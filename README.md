stat545a Final Project- Daniel Dinsdale
===============================
How to run the analysis:
[Here](http://rpubs.com/danieldinsdale/stat545a-2013-hw06_dinsdale-dan) you may observe the cleaned up output with step by step explanations of what I was trying to do. 

To replicate please install the following three files into an empty folder:
[01_origData.R](https://github.com/danieldinsdale/stat545a-2013-hw06_dinsdale-dan/blob/master/01_origData.R)
[02_newData.R](https://github.com/danieldinsdale/stat545a-2013-hw06_dinsdale-dan/blob/master/02_newData.R)
[FinalScript.R](https://github.com/danieldinsdale/stat545a-2013-hw06_dinsdale-dan/blob/master/FinalScript.R)

The final script should be opened in RStudio and sourced.
